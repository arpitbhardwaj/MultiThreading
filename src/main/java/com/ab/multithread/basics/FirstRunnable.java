/**
 * @author Arpit Bhardwaj
 *
 * Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :
 *
 * Extending the Thread class
 * Implementing the Runnable Interface (Recommended)
 *
 * If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance
 * Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
 *
 * join(): It will put the current thread on wait until the thread on which it is called is dead.
 * join(long millis) :It will put the current thread on wait until the thread on which it is called is dead or wait for specified time
 * If thread is interrupted then join methods will throw InterruptedException.
